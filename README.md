This repository contains all of the data and code required for all analyses and figure generation described in Frasier, Hamilton, & Pace (in Review) How should we quantify reproductive performance in the endangered North Atlantic right whale? *Conservation Science and Practice*.

Anyone running the code should make the **code** directory their working directory in R. Everything should then run smoothly. These analyses were conducted in R v4.1.2.
